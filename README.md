**Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.**


This project involved me making a grocery item tracker, mainly analyzing the frequency of items purchased in a given day. It solved the problem of re-organizing a grocery store based on what customers buy most often.

**What did you do particularly well?**

I did the integration of languages particularly well. Combining Python and C++ is something I struggled with quite a bit when I first attempted it, but by the end of the course I am able to do it in a new project in a matter of 10 minutes. Combining languages is very useful, as most complex programs use at least two languages.

**Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?**

I could enhance my code by accounting for errors. While I took into account the potential for human error, I could have gone further by including try/catch statements, as well as exceptions. I still struggle with this area of programming, so it is something I must work on as I improve my codes in the future.

**Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?**

The most challenging pieces of the code were the Python portions, because I have not worked extensively with Python in several months. I overcame this obstacle by going back to old assignments and readings and even using some code that I wrote in previous assignments. I am fortunate to still have access to the zyBook where I first learned Python, and I will continue to use it as a resource for as long as I have access.

**What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?**

The most valuable skill from this project is the process of integrating languages. I am not sure if other language integration works the same way as Python with C++, but I am sure there are similarities regardless. 

**How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**

I made sure that each function in Python had a similar structure, since the operations were fairly similar. I also created a switch-case statement in my main function in C++, meaning that more options can be added to the menu at any time without too much change to the structure of main. All that needs to be added is an extra case and calls to the appropriate functions. This establishes a form of adaptability in the program.
